Some files that make things faster

## To-Do (chelper.py)
- [] Check if .c file contains correct header
- [] Get the name of the function (for the call in the main func)
- [] Check if main function is provided (if yes -> fail -> remove main function | if no append the main function to the bottom of the file and run the method)
- [] norminette check file one by one
- [] in the end diplay result and where passed and failed

chelper.py => would work but the python file doesnt have permission to run bash commands
